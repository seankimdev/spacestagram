## Motivation

As a camping lover, I wanted to create an app which my camping crew can use to to view, edit, and check off items as we prepare for camping. I learned and utilized Firebase to store the data which everyone can access together. It was also a great opportunity to follow best practices in organizing React components to keep the codes clean and reuseable.

## Tech Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Sass
- ES6
- React
- JSX
- Firebase

## Features

- Modern, minimalist, and responsive design
- Fully accessible using only keyboards
- Semantic elements used with appropriate aria-hidden, and sr-only styling to accomodate a wide range of users
- Accessing and modiyfing database stored in Firebase
- Utilizing useEffect and useState hooks to efficiently store states and update DOM based on their updates
- React components organized following best practices
- Sass used to keep styling files organized and separated into generic styling, partials, and component-specific styling
